# iOS Continuous Integration / Deployment


## CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) has tight and well-supported integration with GitHub. This makes it desirable for projects hosted on GitHub. When new branches are pushed out to GitHub, CircleCI can automatically build, test, and deploy the latest release of an app.

## HockeyApp

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) is a relatively flexible platform for app distribution. Testers and end-users of an iOS app can automatically receive emails with the latest updates.
